The Hugging Face transformers package is an immensely popular Python library providing pretrained models that are extraordinarily useful for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well.
While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.

The ktrain library is a lightweight wrapper for tf.keras in TensorFlow 2. 
It is designed to make deep learning and AI more accessible and easier to apply for beginners and domain experts. 
As of version 0.8, ktrain now includes a simplified interface to Hugging Face transformers for text classification.
we will show you how you can build, train, and deploy a text classification model with Hugging Face transformers.
