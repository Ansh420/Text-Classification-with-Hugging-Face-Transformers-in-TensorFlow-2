# Text-Classification-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers-in-TensorFlow-2
The objective is to build a model that can predict the newsgroup category for a given post.

The Hugging Face transformers package is an immensely popular Python library providing pretrained models that are extraordinarily useful for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well.
While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.
